                <h3>Hello there! I'm Aishwarya Sriram.</h3>
                <hr>
                <h4>I am a full stack software engineer.</h4>
                <p>I am the first woman in the entire history of my family to pursue a graduate degree. Growing up, my parents always emphasized the significance of education. As a result, I have developed a deep appreciation for it and am in continuous pursuit of learning and teaching. I enjoyed and thrived in the rigor of my undergraduate curriculum in Information Technology, which was challenging yet rooted in familiarity as I had been studying computer science and programming since high school. I also led group studies for my peers, which allowed me to express my love for this field in a creative way.
                </p>
